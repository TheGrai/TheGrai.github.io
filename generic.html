							<p>The afternoon sun was smiling down upon the seas. The seagulls filled the air with joyous laughter. The water was like a glass floor that the boats cut through like diamonds. Amy hung off the bow of her familyâ€™s yacht. She felt the warmth of the sun on her back the light shining through the water and lighting up the seabed. Something, was peculiar though. This fish seemed to be agitated by something out at sea; something big. The sea began to rumble like a bear growling from a cave. The sound had a low pitch that carried with it a warning of power. On the horizon a wall of water rose out of the ground like the souls who escape the grave. Like a marching army, the army did not stop for anything. A small fleet of fishing trawlers where thrown like spears. Amy tried to yell a warning to her parents, but she could not move. Her mind yelled run but her body said stay. Only her wide-open eyes could survey the wall of anger. The slenderness of the yacht faced the swirling, spitting, fortification of water. It rode up the wave halfway until it was near vertical. The rigging groaning in protest. Crash, the deck of the ship hit the sea as Amy twirled in the current. Why would her arms not move? The bubbles from the ship mocking her to breath. This was not the day she was going to die. Reaching out she caught a deck chair cushion from the yacht and started to kick towards the surface.</p>
